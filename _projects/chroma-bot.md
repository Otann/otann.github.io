This project is a dead simple bot for Telegram that detects colors in messages in hex form (like `#dc322f`) and sends back a picture filled with that color.

I developed it to see how Telegram's Bot API work and to play with it.

The project turned out to be very simple, so I decided to use it for an opening for Web Fandango series. That simplicity allowed me to cover basic things, like projects, namespaces and routing for web services. This project is also an excellent illustration of how to use core.async.

You can check out sources on the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Otann/chroma-bot).

Here is the list of posts from the series about the bot:
