You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn start!
  "Starts long-polling process"
  []
  (log/debug "Trying to start polling threads")
  (reset! updates (chan))
  (reset! running true)

  ;; Start infinite loop inside go-routine
  ;; that will pull messages from channel
  (go (loop []
        (handle (<! @updates))
        (if @running (recur))))

  ;; Start thread with polling process
  ;; that will populate channel
  (thread (loop [offset 0]
            (let [updates-data (api/get-updates {:offset offset})
                  new-offset (if (empty? updates-data)
                               offset
                               (-> updates-data last :update_id inc))]
              (doseq [update updates-data] (>!! @updates update))
              (if @running (recur new-offset)))))

  (log/info "Started long-polling for Telegram updates"))
{% endhighlight %}
