# Anton Chebotaev

I have substantial experience, which includes eight years of developing APIs for web applications and internal systems, which is supposed to sound extremely seriously, business-related and dull.

I find that they often get too serious, and start asking about who will be the target audience or what is the business model and what not.

In this blog I hope to inspire people and encourage them to do more stunning and beautiful small projects for fun and not for profit.
