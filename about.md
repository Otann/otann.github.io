Hi, I'm Anton and I've been developing for six years.

Right now I'm looking for a job.

I offer substantial experience, which includes 6 years of developing APIs for web applications and internal systems. Applying my meticulous tech vision toward software problems and combining that diligence with my critical thinking skills and passion for finding simple and unique solutions to complex challenges would make me a solid asset to your community.

Please inspect my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonchebotaev) or [download my CV](/CV_AntonChebotaev.pdf) and pass it to your hiring committee.

Thank you!
