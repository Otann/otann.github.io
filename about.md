Hi, my name is Anton, and I am a full-stack web developer.

I have substantial experience, which includes six years of developing APIs for web applications and internal systems, which is supposed to sound extremely seriously, business-related and dull.

Someday I realized that I can use programming for entertainment purposes and had a couple of projects in my mind to illustrate that. When sharing a project idea with people, I found that they often get too serious, and start asking about who will be the target audience or what is the business model.

I'm going to do a complete opposite here, creating and inventing things for the sole purpose of fun. And  I hope to inspire people and encourage them to do more stunning and beautiful small projects, that will impress others with their awesomeness.

My dream is to have a club of individuals with a shared passion of *fandangoing* around with code, making things that will start to have a life of its own, like legends that travel across oceans.

Thank you for your attention, enjoy the content and have fun!
